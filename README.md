# About me

I am Anand Jacob Abraham, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I completed my BTech in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Calicut, my MTech in Industrial Engineering and Management from the National Institute of Technology Calicut, and my PhD in Management Studies from the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. My research focuses on resource economics, cooperative game theory, and pricing problems in supply chain management. In 2022, I received the Indian Economics Association medal in recognition of the academic contributions of my PhD work. My research has been published in prestigious journals such as Mathematical Social Sciences and Economics Letters.

# Research

I am interested in topics of Resource economics, Game theory, Supply chain management, and Applied operations Research. Here is a brief overview of my research activities.

## River sharing and pollution
This research is concerned with understanding the behaviour of countries or states which share a river under situation of conflict and cooperation. Many existing studies which are carried out in the area investigate the allocation of water in a pollution free environment. We seek to understand how pollution would impact water allocation decisions and cooperative endeavours like bilateral water trade. We show that water trade becomes adversely affected by presence of pollutants.

## Bilateral river water markets and dams
In many shared rivers, agents (riparian states) build dams. Although, dams have the typical purpose of meeting water demands during water scarce situations, they have some unintended consequences if the agents are sharing water by means of free market interactions. Our study shows that such interactions under certain conditions can lead to upstream agents storing water exclusively for trading and thus introducing artificial scarity. This behavior leads to social welfare loss. We illustrate the findings of this study using secondary data from the Cauvery river basin in Karnataka state.

## Flood cost sharing
In transboundary rivers, property rights and responsibilities are often contested. This is mainly due to the absence of supranational institutions and unique apportionment principles. In such contexts, the sharing of externality damages becomes a tricky issue. Although the problem of sharing pollution costs fairly among riparian states is discussed by Ni and Wang (2007) in their paper in GEB as well as many follow up research articles, the issue of floods have not been taken up. In our study, we consider the problem of a linear river system in which agents release water into the river during some surplus period, and flood damages are realized as a result. The problem concerns how to divide these damages fairly among riparian states. We adopt an axiomatic approach and propose the Sequential Upstream Proportional Allocation (SUPA) rule as the unique solution that satisfies the axioms of efficiency, downstream independence, and proportionality. Also, the solution is identified in terms of appropriate cooperative game theoretic solution concepts.
