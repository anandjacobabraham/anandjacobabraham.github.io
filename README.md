##About me

I am Anand Jacob Abraham, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I completed my BTech in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Calicut, my MTech in Industrial Engineering and Management from the National Institute of Technology Calicut, and my PhD in Management Studies from the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. My research focuses on resource economics, cooperative game theory, and pricing problems in supply chain management. In 2022, I received the Indian Economics Association medal in recognition of the academic contributions of my PhD work. My research has been published in prestigious journals such as Mathematical Social Sciences and Economics Letters.

##Research

I am interested in topics of Resource economics, Game theory, Supply chain management, and Applied operations Research. Here is a brief overview of my research activities.

###River sharing and pollution
This research is concerned with understanding the behaviour of countries or states which share a river under situation of conflict and cooperation. Many existing studies which are carried out in the area investigate the allocation of water in a pollution free environment. We seek to understand how pollution would impact water allocation decisions and cooperative endeavours like bilateral water trade. We show that water trade becomes adversely affected by presence of pollutants.

###Bilateral river water markets and dams
In many shared rivers, agents (riparian states) build dams. Although, dams have the typical purpose of meeting water demands during water scarce situations, they have some unintended consequences if the agents are sharing water by means of free market interactions. Our study shows that such interactions under certain conditions can lead to upstream agents storing water exclusively for trading and thus introducing artificial scarity. This behavior leads to social welfare loss. We illustrate the findings of this study using secondary data from the Cauvery river basin in Karnataka state.
